```{margin} Watch the race highlights here

```
Based on the analysis within this book -  we can conclude that VER outperformed his teammate PER in Abu Dhabi 2022. Max goes on to win the race and Sergio fails to be beat Charles -  therefore losing out on P2 in the championship. {numref}`speed_q` and {numref}`RPM_q` highlight how VER was faster in [Qualification](Abu_Dhabi_Quali.ipynb) - by both were he was carrying speed and how the engine was responding. {numref}`lap_fig`and {numref}`ST_fig` in [Race](Abu_Dhabi_Race.ipynb) show how Max's pace was more consistent despite being on a different pit strategy. Despite having the advantage of DRS, PER was unable to match Max or Charles' pace throughout the race.

```{warning}
Max wins the race and has already won the championship - he's faster than the rest of the field, including Perez
